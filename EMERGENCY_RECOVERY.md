# 🚨 EMERGENCY RECOVERY GUIDE
## "Break Glass in Case You Forget How to Recover"

### 📊 **CURRENT STATUS & PROGRESS TRACKER**

**Last Updated:** UnifiedPoolMonitorService created successfully
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 - Core Service Creation (1/4 complete)
**Next Action:** Create PoolStateManager service

#### 🎯 **REFACTOR PROGRESS**
- [x] **Phase 1:** Create safety checkpoint (COMPLETE)
- [x] **Phase 2:** Create emergency recovery guide (COMPLETE)
- [x] **Phase 3:** Begin refactor planning (COMPLETE)
- [🔄] **Phase 4:** Consolidate monitoring services (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] **Phase 5:** Improve error handling
- [ ] **Phase 6:** Performance optimization
- [ ] **Phase 7:** Enhanced logging
- [ ] **Phase 8:** Configuration streamlining

#### 🚨 **IF YOU'RE PANICKING RIGHT NOW**
1. **Take a deep breath** - You have a complete safety net
2. **Run:** `git reset --hard 4941496`
3. **You're back to a working state**
4. **Check this file again** - I'll update it with current progress

#### 📝 **CURRENT CONTEXT**
- **Working Branch:** `pool-monitor-deep-dive`
- **Safe Commit:** `4941496`
- **Current Focus:** Creating supporting services (PoolStateManager next)
- **Recent Changes:** UnifiedPoolMonitorService created with lifecycle management
- **Mood:** "Swing away, Merrill!" 🎬

#### 📋 **REFACTOR PLAN CREATED**
- **REFACTOR_PLAN.md** - Comprehensive refactor strategy
- **New Architecture:** 7 services (4 core + 3 supporting)
- **Approach:** Gradual migration, not big bang
- **Safety:** Multiple rollback points and feature flags

#### ✅ **COMPLETED SERVICES**
- **UnifiedPoolMonitorService** - Main monitoring service with lifecycle management
  - Pool state tracking (pending → teed up → status 6 → monitoring)
  - Event broadcasting for all pool stages
  - Automatic cleanup and health checks
  - Configuration-driven limits and intervals

### 🚀 **QUICK RECOVERY COMMANDS**

If you're lost during refactor, run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. See recent commits to find the checkpoint
git log --oneline -10

# 3. RETURN TO SAFE STATE (commit 4941496)
git reset --hard 4941496

# 4. Verify you're back to safety
git log --oneline -1
```

### 📍 **YOUR SAFE COMMIT**
- **Commit Hash:** `4941496`
- **Message:** "🚀 PRE-REFACTOR CHECKPOINT: Stable foundation before major refactor"
- **Branch:** `pool-monitor-deep-dive`

### 🔍 **WHAT WAS WORKING BEFORE REFACTOR**

#### ✅ **Core Systems**
- Pool monitoring (hybrid approach)
- Status-6 monitoring
- WebSocket listeners
- Database operations
- Health checks

#### 📁 **Key Files That Were Stable**
- `src/monitor/pool-monitor.service.ts`
- `src/monitor/hybrid-pool-monitor.service.ts`
- `src/scripts/pool-monitor/monitor.ts`
- `src/gateway/gateway.service.ts`
- `src/types/market.ts`

#### 🧪 **Testing Status**
- Basic pool monitoring: ✅ Working
- Status-6 monitoring: ✅ Working
- WebSocket connections: ✅ Working
- Database operations: ✅ Working
- Health checks: ✅ Working

### 🛠️ **IF YOU NEED TO START OVER**

```bash
# Complete reset to checkpoint
git reset --hard 4941496
git clean -fd  # Remove any untracked files
npm install    # Reinstall dependencies
```

### 📋 **REFACTOR GOALS (for reference)**
1. Consolidate monitoring services
2. Improve error handling and recovery
3. Optimize performance and memory usage
4. Enhance logging and debugging capabilities
5. Streamline configuration management

### 🆘 **IF YOU'RE STILL LOST**

1. **Check the commit message:** `git show 4941496`
2. **Look at the documentation:**
   - `ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md`
   - `TESTING_GUIDE.md`
   - `REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md`
3. **Run a quick test:** `npm run test` or `npm run start:dev`

### 💡 **PRO TIP**
Before making major changes, create a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b refactor-attempt-1
# If it goes wrong, just delete the branch and start over
git checkout pool-monitor-deep-dive
git branch -D refactor-attempt-1
```

### 🎯 **REMEMBER**
- **Commit 4941496 is your safety net**
- **Everything was working before the refactor**
- **You can always start fresh from this point**
- **The goal is cleaner, more maintainable code**
