- **Rug detection** (11.5% of trades) was perfect (100% win rate)
- **Trailing stops** (10.6% of trades) were problematic (9.1% win rate)

- **10% stop loss** prevented catastrophic losses
- **15% take profit** captured gains consistently

### **4. Market Conditions**

---

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **1. Trailing Stop Loss Problems**
**Issue:** Trailing stops had only 9.1% success rate, causing premature exits

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Trailing stops activated too early (3% profit)
- Trailing distance (2%) was too tight
- Market volatility triggered premature exits
- Loss of potential profits on winning trades

**Impact:** Significant profit loss on otherwise profitable trades

### **2. Stop Loss Ineffectiveness**
**Issue:** All stop loss exits (6.7% of trades) were losing trades

**Problem:** Stop losses triggered at -10% but trades were already down significantly

**Impact:** Failed to protect capital effectively

### **3. Runner Detection Not Functioning**
**Issue:** "Ready for runner detection" messages appear but never progress past attempt 1/5

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Runner detection criteria may be too strict
- Volume tracking implementation incomplete
- TVL bounce calculations using incorrect baseline
- Cooldown periods may be preventing progression

**Impact:** Missing significant post-rug recovery opportunities

### **4. Post-Rug Recovery Timing Issues**
**Issue:** Waiting for token to return to original price before entering

**Problem:** This eliminates the benefit of buying the bottom once upward trend is confirmed

**Impact:** Reduced profit potential on recovery trades

### **5. Missing Cooldown Period After Exits**
**Issue:** No confirmation period to validate upward trends before re-entry

**Problem:** May re-enter too quickly on false signals

**Impact:** Potential for premature entries and unnecessary losses

---

## üìà **TRENDS & PATTERNS**

### **1. Entry Timing**
- **Early entries** (within 30 minutes of pool creation) were most profitable
- **TVL-based entries** (10%+ increase) showed better success rates
- **Price momentum** (3%+ increase) was reliable entry signal

### **2. Exit Patterns**
- **Take profit hits** (15%) were common and consistent (88.2% success)
- **Rug detection** was highly effective (100% success rate)
- **Trailing stops** were problematic (9.1% success rate)
- **Stop losses** were ineffective (0% success rate)
- **Time-based exits** (60 minutes) were mixed (83.3% success rate)

### **3. Position Management**
- **Concurrent positions** (up to 3) maximized opportunity capture
- **Quick turnover** prevented over-exposure to single pools
- **Risk distribution** across multiple pools reduced portfolio risk

### **4. Market Behavior**
- **New pool launches** were frequent during test period
- **Momentum-driven** price movements were common
- **Rug patterns** were detectable and avoidable
- **Recovery opportunities** existed but were underutilized

---

### **4. Implement Post-Exit Cooldown**
**Priority:** HIGH
